## Step 1: Audio Loop-Back Through Linux

In this step was wrote in VHDL two IPs: Audio To Axi and Axi To Audio. Also, we wrote the Audio Copy Driver.

### Audio To Axi

### Axi To Audio

### Audio Copy Driver

## Step 2: Receive Audio Over Network in Linux and Play it Back

## Step 3: Mixing the Two Streams, Multi-Threading

## Step 4: Resource Sharing, Adding Filters and Volume Control
